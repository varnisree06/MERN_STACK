            A dosa is a thin savory crepe in South Indian
             cuisine made from a fermented batter of ground black gram and rice. Dosas are served hot, often
             with chutney and sambar (a lentil-based vegetable stew). Dosas are popular in South Asia as well 
             as around the world.
